Tests of Scala, Casbah, and MongoDB
===================================

This project is a series of small tests of using MongoDB with Scala, specifically using the Casbah driver for MongoDB.

If you run the usual "sbt run" command, you'll be presented with a list of "main" methods you can run. Assuming you have a MongoDB instance up and running, you should start with Inserts, then Find, then try the others as desired.
