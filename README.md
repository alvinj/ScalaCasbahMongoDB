Tests of Scala, Casbah, and MongoDB
===================================

This project is a series of small tests of using MongoDB with Scala, specifically using the Casbah driver for MongoDB.

Prerequisites
-------------

Prerequisites:

* MongoDB up and running.
* Scala 2.9.1+
* SBT, probably 0.11+

Running
-------

If you run the usual "sbt run" command, you'll be presented with a list of "main" methods you can run. Assuming you have a MongoDB instance up and running, you should start with Inserts, which populates the data, then Find, then try the others as desired.

Checkout a Copy
---------------

You can checkout a read-only copy of this project using "git clone <url>".
